# bybit_insider
Trading library for Bybit exchange. You can use for mainnet testnet copy and copytestnet.

 The project has several methods that can be used to place orders, such as "market_order" and 
 "limit_order". It takes several parameters on initialization, including an API key and secret key, 
 which are used to authenticate with the Bybit API. 
 The script also uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the Bybit API. 
 The script is designed to work in different modes, such as normal trading, 
 test trading, copy trading and copytest trading. 
 The script also allows to use different types of order such as stop loss and take profit.
